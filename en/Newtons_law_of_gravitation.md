# Explanation of Newtons Law of Gravitation


Newtons Law of Gravitation explains the nature of the `Gravitational force` which is a force of attraction between two objects having definite mass and at a distance
which is greater than 0.The law states that the force of gravitation is inversly proportional to the square of distance between the two distinct object.The force
applied on object 1 is equal in magnitude to the force applied on object 2 but opposite in direction. 

**Formula of Newtons Law of Gravitation:**

F = (G * M_1 * M_2) / (r)^2
where
G= Universal gravitational Constant
M_1 = Mass of Distinct Object 1
M_2 = Mass of Distinct Object 2
r = Distance between Distinct Object 1 and Distinct Object 2

**Method of Using the Newtons Law of Gravitation:**

Using the above given fromula, we just have to place the variables in their respective places:
- **G (Universal Gravitational Constant)**=`6.6743e-11`. Unit of **G** is N(m^2)/(Kg^2).
- **M_1**=`Mass of Distinct object 1 `. Unit of **M_1** is Kg.
- **M_2**=`Mass of Distinct object 2 `. Unit of **M_2** is Kg.
- **r**=`Distance between distinct object 1 and distinct object 2`. Unit of **r** is m(Meter).

# Assumptions

- The 2 distinct objects must not be weightless .
- Their centers of gravity must not be one i.e they must have their centers of gravity away from each other.
- This formula can only be used to calculate the Gravitation Force for 2 objects in a instance.


# Uses 

This law is used to determine the Force of attraction between 2 distinct Objects/Bodies , in order to calculate the rate of acceleration of either body towards the 
other body with one being at a complete stop .

# Example:-

Let M_1 be a Iron ball of mass `5 * 10^6 Kg` and M_2 be a Copper ball of mass `10^4 Kg` and the seperation between the 2 objects **r**=100m
Then the Graviational force between the 2 distinct objects is = `0.0003337 N`  or  `3.337 * 10^-4 N`
